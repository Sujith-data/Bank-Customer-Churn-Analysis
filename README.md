# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

This dataset contains 10,000 records, each of it corresponds to a different bank's user. The target is Exited, a binary variable that describes whether the user decided to leave the bank. In the dataset, there are customer identifiers, four columns describing personal information about the customer (surname, location, gender and age), and some other columns containing information related to the loan (such as credit score, current balance in the user's account and whether they are an active member among others).

Being proactive, detecting in advance if a customer is planning to leave, and reacting in time to convince them to stay can result in a more satisfied customer base. Also, it can help understand your customers and why they like or dislike your business. This dataset can help a banking institution reduce churn and offer more tailored products to their customers.
